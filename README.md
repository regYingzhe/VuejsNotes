# VuejsNotes
## Interact with DOM:
1. template can directly access the data and methods object through {{}}
2. vue can't bind link in html only in the htmlText field. Do something like this: `<a v-bind:herf="link"></a>`
3. v-once can disable re-rendering and only stick to its initial value in the data object
4. localhost:8080/#/usr. the part infront the # is sent to server. it will give us index.html file. usr is handle to runing java application and may be handle by that application.
